**Description:**

CoronaMana is my mid exam project for the Human-Computer Interaction course in my Semester 4 of Computer Science Major at BINUS University.

CoronaMana is a mobile-based application with a purpose to encourage people to stay away from areas indicated with COVID-19 traces so that infection count can be minimalized.

Features:
- Giving location information of people indicated with COVID-19 infection (ODP, PDP, Suspect, Positive, and Cured)
- Giving information of the history of places where the infected person went
- Live count of COVID-19 infection in Indonesia (cases, death, and cured)
- Giving tips to prevent infection of COVID-19
- Report feature to report COVID-19 cases around the user
